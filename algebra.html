    <p>  On my way to fulfilling my career I must go to college. The college that I have decided to attend is Georgia State University. 
    I will be majoring in education during my 4 years there. After I graduate from there I will be working at Albany Middle school which is located in Albany,GA. There I will be a teacher that teaches 6th-8th grade math.
<br>
<br>
  While settling down I have to first budget myself. I will be making $36,760 a year, before taxes are deducted, while working as a teacher. 
  But after taxes all I have $24,292 and with this I have to pay for many things. I will be making $1,822 a month. It is important that I budget myself so I can have enough to survive, have a roof over my head and a car.
  I have to make sure that I have everything I need to succeed at doing my job, arriving on time and that I am eating.
<br>
<br>
  I have found a two-bedroom apartment in Albany, GA for $450 a month. My apartment is 2.2 miles away from the school that I will be working at so I only have to pay $25-$50 a month. 
  I plan on spending $300 dollars on food to make sure I can come home and cook everyday and so I can still have my midnight snacks. 
  I plan on spending $50 on internet and cable so I can still watch tv and have wi-fi to do my work. I plan on spending $60 on my cellphone bill so that I can still communicate with co-workers, friends and family. 
  I plan to also spend no more than $91 on clothes because I like to shop but I donâ€™t want to spend a lot so I can get like a new outfit every month. 
<br>
<br>
  Every year I plan on putting up $3000 for my retirement funds. I plan to put this much up so that when I retire I can go places and travel because I like to travel.
  Every month I will put $91 in savings for a rainy day. after paying for everything each month I will have $307 in disposable income. 
  With this money I will use it however and buy whatever comes to mind. If I dont really buy anything I plan on putting the rest on my money into savings.
<br>
<br>
  I personally believe that budgeting yourself is a very helpful tool in life. It keeps you from spending too much money on unessecary things. 
  Creating a budget makes sure the important things are paid for before the less important things are. 
  Its also a good way to stay organized and to know what your money has to be spent on and how much you plan on having left.</p>
