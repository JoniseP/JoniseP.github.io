<p>After doing this project our overall final piece was a success. I really liked this project and I enjoyed working with my group members. During this project I think I did well at trasitioning the colors and measuring the wood. I believe that the way we painted the pieces was really good. Our statement was nice and strong and the colors we chose main the meaning more powerful.

From this project ive learned that colors really help when it comes to art. The whole piece wounldnt have came alive if it wasnt for the colors that we chose. Using the proper color scemes can have a big affect on the overall meaning. Ive also learned that its important to plan things out because the process goes smoother. After planning everything out step by step we ended with a complete project, on time and it looked very nice.

During this project me and my group faced many problems. We were a little indecisive on what colors to use. We also had problems with having enough wood for our sound wave. Other classes were doing similiar things so they took our wood and that created an issue. After with dealing with these problems we just continued on with the process and just found new pieces. We also finally agreed on the perfect color sceme to use for our project.

Overall I really enjoyed doing this project. I love being creative and making things and using my creative thoughts and bringng them to life. I mainly enjoyed painting because I like to paint and it keeps me occupied. It was a little challenging mixing colors and having a good transition but it looked good in the end. I enjoyed the whole project overall and I hope we have even better projects in the future.

<br><p>The purpose of our installation, Can You Feel It?, is to show several different emotions based from drawings we thought represented our emotions. We also used different colors that we thought represented the emotion we chose as well. The overall vision is to get the viewers to understand what emotion each image portrays. We had to do something that took up space and give it meaning.
I feel like I played a very important role in my group. During the working process, I actually worked on the third and the final draft of the artist statement. I had to keep editing the paper and make sure it was good and that it was high quality work. I also worked on the notes that had to be documented every day during the project, describing specifically the items our group was working on. I also worked on my individual box which I had to draw a picture and paint and put the box together. 
Something that worked well in my project was how neat and crafted my box was. My paint was very neat and even the color I chose was very bright and a good representation of happy. I also had a really nice picture that represented happy which was a smile because people smile when they are happy. Also, something that worked well was how all the drawings and the colors complimented each other within the group once installed. The emotion boxes were unified.
To improve the project, I would honestly change the size of the boxes to be much larger. I would change the size of the boxes because I feel like it didnâ€™t make up enough space. I would also change the drawing I used. I would change it because I feel like I could portray happiness in other ways beyond a smile. 
From this project Ive learned how people view different emotions based off what my teammates did to represent their emotions. Ive also learned that an installation is 3-D art that are often site-specific and designed to transform the perception of a space and how many different ideas you can use as an installation. Ive also learned that you should let your imagination guide you when it comes to being creative because it helps.
